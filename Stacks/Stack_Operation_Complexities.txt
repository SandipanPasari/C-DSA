The **push** operation, which adds an element to the top of the stack, has a time complexity of O(1). The **pop** operation which removes the top element, also has a time complexity of O(1). The **peek** or **top** operation, which retrieves the top element without removing it, has a time complexity of O(1). The **isEmpty** operation, which checks if the stack is empty, has a time complexity of O(1). The **size** operation, which returns the number of elements in the stack, has a time complexity of O(1) if the size is maintained as a variable. Finally, the **display** operation, which prints all the elements in the stack, has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the stack, because it needs to iterate through all the elements to print them.
