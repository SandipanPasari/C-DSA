1. Node Structure:
    Define a structure for the linked list nodes. Each node should have two fields:
    data: The actual value (element) stored in the stack.
    next: A pointer to the next node in the linked list.

2. Initialization:
    Initialize an empty stack by setting the head pointer (top) to NULL.

3. Push Operation (Add an Element):
    To push an element onto the stack Create a new node with the given data.
    Set the new nodeâ€™s next pointer to the current top (head) of the stack.
    Update the top pointer to point to the new node

4. Pop Operation (Remove an Element):
    To pop an element from the stack Check if the stack is empty (i.e., if the top pointer is NULL). If not empty, remove the top node.
    Update the top pointer to point to the next node.

Peek Operation (Get the Top Element):
    To get the top element without removing it:
    Check if the stack is empty.
    If not empty, return the value stored in the top node. 

Display Operation (Print All Elements):
    Traverse the linked list and print each element (from top to bottom).`
