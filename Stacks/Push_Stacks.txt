1. Check if the Stack Is Full:
    Before pushing an element onto the stack, we need to ensure that there is enough space.
    If the stack is already full (i.e., the top pointer is at the maximum capacity), we display an “Overflow” message.

2. If Not Full, Increment the Top Pointer:
    If the stack is not full, we increment the top pointer to indicate that we are adding an element.
    The new top pointer position will be TOP + 1.
    
3. Add the New Element to the Stack:
    We insert the new element (let’s call it X) into the position pointed to by the updated top pointer.
    In an array-based implementation, this means storing X in the array at index TOP.
    
4. Exit:
    The push operation is complete
