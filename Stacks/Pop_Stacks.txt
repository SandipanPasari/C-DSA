1. Take a Variable:
    We need to store the popped data in a variable.
    Hence we will declare a variable to store data.

2. We will check if the stack is empty:
    If the stack is empty we will not be able to return any value from the stack so we need to ensure if there is any element present or not.

3. Poping out the Element:
    Now we will store the element to be popped in the variable and pop it.
    After popping the element we will decrement the top value by 1.

4. Exit:
    Pop operation is over.
